Your mama so fat, Thanos had to clap
You're about as useful as Anne Frank's drumset.
I would ask you what your problem is, but you probably can't even pronounce it
I'm thinking you weren't burdened with an overabundance of schooling
How did your brain ever learn human speech? Im curious
Youre as useless as the 'ueue' in 'queue'
Mirrors can't talk. Lucky for you, they can't laugh either
Hey, you have something on your chin...no, the third one down
Some day you'll go far, and I hope you stay there
If laughter is the best medicine, your face must be curing the world
So, a thought crossed your mind? Must've been a long and lonely journey
When I see your face, there's nothing I'd change...except the direction I was walking in
If I had a dollar for every time you said something smart...I'd pretty much be broke
I'd slap you, but that'd be animal abuse
Everyone who has ever loved you was wrong.
How did your brain even learn human speech? Im curious.
You have a face only a mother could pretend to love.
